Before You Begin
----------------

If you have absolutely no Unix experience, you may want to ask around
for someone with a little bit of Unix knowledge to help you through 
this installation.  Every attempt has been made to make it as simple
as possible, but since the software is quite involved and relies on a
number of different components, it is not realistic to assume it will
go smoothly on all systems.  You will probably need someone around who
knows the particulars of the destination system well.

If this is your first exposure to PHP, please be aware that PHP Version 
2.0 is quickly going to be superceded by Version 3.0.  There are
dramatic improvements.  Please see http://www.php.net/
for more information, and if at all possible I suggest you start out
with PHP3 instead of proceeding with PHP2 today and then being forced
to migrate in a couple of months.

Windows NT Version
------------------

The code compiles almost cleanly using gnu-win32 gcc from Cygnus.
See http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32/

A pre-compiled Windows95/NT binary is available in the file archive at
http://php.iquest.net/

You will need the Cygnus GCC DLL file available at:
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest/cygwin.dll
Install this dll somewhere on your path.

You will also find a couple of MSVC 5.0 compiled binaries at
http://www.caraveo.com/php/
These may or may not function better for you.

PHP Version 3.0 will have much better Windows support, so if you are
interested in running PHP on Windows, I suggest you start with version
3.0 available from http://www.php.net/


Things You Need To Know Before Installing
-----------------------------------------

- Can you run both GET and POST method cgi programs on your server?

  If not, you can not use this package.  On many public ISP's CGI
  programs are either disallowed or severely restricted.  If this is
  the case on your system, talk to your system administrator and ask
  him/her to have a look at this package and see if they will install
  it for you.

- If you have mSQL installed on your system, you need to know the
  base directory of this installation.

- If you are going to be using this with sybase, you must have sybase db
  library and include files available. If you are not using this on DEC OSF1,
  remove the -ldnet_stub from src/Makefile, after running install.

- If you have Postgres95 installed on your system, you need to know the
  base directory of this installation.

- If you have mysql installed on your system, you need to know the
  base directory of this installation.

- You need an ANSI-C compatible C compiler (gcc is fine).

- If you are going to be using this with mSQL, you need to install
  mSQL before you install PHP/FI.

- If you are going to be using this with Postgres95, you need to
  install at least the libpq.a library from the Postgres95 
  distribution before installing PHP/FI.

- If you are going to be using gdbm, install gdbm before installing
  PHP.

- If you are going to be using GD, install GD before installing PHP/FI.

- If you are installing the Apache module version, you will need to 
  know the Apache src code directory location.


FI Notes
---------

[This is more of a historical sub-note now.  PHP and FI are one and
 the same today.]
 
FI is a subset of the PHP distribution.  Throughout the documentation
PHP and FI will be used interchangeably or together.  They refer to
the same thing.  On my system here the difference between FI and PHP
is that the FI binary is compiled without the access logging and
access restriction code thus producing a faster parser for doing simple
database-enabled web pages.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

If you do not have gcc installed on your system, make sure you turn 
on any compiler switches you need to make your compiler as ANSI 
compliant as possible.  The package is known to compile without
problems on the following systems.  If you manage to compile the
package on a system not listed here, please send me some e-mail
at: rasmus@lerdorf.on.ca with the name of your OS and the version 
number and any other details I should know.

Solaris 2.4
Solaris 2.5[.1]
Solaris 2.6
SunOS 4.1.2
SunOS 4.1.3
SunOS 4.1.4
Linux 1.3.x
Linux 2.0.x
Linux 2.1.x
BSDi 2.0
OSF1 (disable MMAP in config.h after running install)
FreeBSD (all versions)
NetBSD 1.2
NetBSD 1.2.1
Irix
Ultrix
HP-UX
OpenStep v4.1 (add -posix to compiler flags)

Step 1.

  Run the install program: ./install

  You will be asked a number of questions.  If you do not understand
  what is being asked, simply hit return.  The default choice should
  be safe on most systems.

Step 2.

  Go into the src directory: cd src

  Have a look at the php.h file.  There are a number of compile-time
  options that can be set here.

Step 3.

  (If you are compiling for Apache 1.3 go to your Apache source tree
   and copy os/unix/os.h to src/main within the Apache tree, then go
   back to your PHP directory and continue)

  type: make

  This will create the actual executable program file named php.cgi
  by default.  (If you are NOT installing the Apache module version)

Step 4. (If you are NOT installing the Apache module version)
  
  Copy the php.cgi binary to your system's cgi-bin directory.  If you
  do not have access to do this and wish to install it in your own
  personal directory, you may do so, but you should set the setuid
  bit on the executable with: chmod u+s /path/php.cgi
  Setting the setuid bit is not crucial.  The benefit is that any files
  created by php will be owned by you.  This means that you can edit
  and delete such files directly.  Without the setuid bit set these
  files will be owned by the httpd user id.

Step 4a. (if you are installing the Apache module version for Apache 1.2 or lower)

  Change to your Apache src directory where the mod_php.c ,mod_php.h
  and libphp.a files should have been copied to. If they weren't which 
  usually happens because of permission problems, copy these three files 
  there manually. Edit your Apache Configuration file and add the 
  EXTRA_LIBS line which was produced at the end of Step 3. And add:

    Module php_module mod_php.o

  to the very end of the file. Then type: ./Configure and then 'make' to 
  rebuild your Apache httpd binary. Install this binary.


Step 4a. (if you are installing the Apache module version for Apache 1.3 or higher)


  Copy libphp.a, mod_php.[ch] and mod_php.module to src/modules/extra in your
  Apache 1.3 source tree.  Then add the following line to the end of your 
  Apache Configuration file:

    AddModule modules/extra/mod_php.o

  Then run ./Configure followed by a 'make' to rebuild your Apache httpd binary.
  Install this binary.


Step 4b.

  Next you need to edit your Apache conf/srm.conf file and add a line like:

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .phtml

  This defines a new MIME, application/x-httpd-php, which will trigger the
  PHP module to parse any file ending with the .phtml extension. You can pick
  any extension you like for this.

  Now you are ready to restart your httpd server. See the Apache Module
  Notes for more details on configuring the PHP Module.


Step 5.

  Copy the doc/doc.html file to somewhere in your web document tree
  and read it using your favourite browser.  This file is the overall
  documentation for the package.


Testing the software
--------------------

  Once installed you can test to see if your executable works by 
  entering a URL similar to the following in your browser:

  http://your.site.domain/cgi-bin/php.cgi

  This should show you a page which contains the version number along
  with various other useful information. 

  To test the Apache module version, create any file with a .phtml
  extension and put a tag like: <?phpinfo()> in the file and see if
  it gets parsed.


Using the software
------------------

  To actually use the software on an existing HTML file, you can 
  simply append the path to your file to the above URL.  ie.

  http://your.site.domain/cgi-bin/php.cgi/path/file.html

  There are ways to automatically run your files through PHP.  These
  methods are discussed in detail in the documentation.  

  Have a look in the examples directory for some examples of web pages
  developed using PHP/FI.

  Documentation, such that it is, can be found in the doc directory.


Troubleshooting and Mailing Lists
---------------------------------

  There is a PHP mailing-list available for general discussion about
  PHP/FI.  If you are having difficulties, this is probably
  the best place to ask.  To sign up, send an empty message to:

  php-list-subscribe@php.iquest.net

  Please make sure you have read through doc/doc.html before asking
  questions on the mailing list. 

  Online documentation, plus the latest version of the software can
  be found at http://php.iquest.net/

  There is a low-traffic mailing list which only contains announcements.
  To subscribe to it, send an empty message to:

  php-announce-subscribe@php.iquest.net

  All announcements will also be sent to the php-list@php.iquest.net mailing
  list, so you need not sign up to both.

  If you are interested in helping out with the development of PHP/FI,
  you can sign up to the php-dev@php.iquest.net list by sending an empty
  message to:

  php-dev-subscribe@php.iquest.net

  This list is quite technical and concentrates on code development.
  You will not be popular if you post general beginner questions here.
  There are also quite a few CVS commit log messages posted here.
  Especially during heavy hacking periods.


Sending in Bug Reports 
----------------------

  I appreciate receiving well-versed bug reports.  If they include a
  possible fix for the problem, I become quite estatic.  If you think
  you have found a bug and you can reproduce it, try to simplify the
  script that illustrates the bug to the least number of lines of
  code as possible.  Try compiling the CGI version of the package
  and pass it through that.  ie. ./php.cgi filename.phtml
  
  If you are using the Apache module version and you get a 
  "Document contains no data" error, it is likely that the web server
  process core dumped.  Check your web server's error_log file.  If
  you are getting a core dump and you can reproduce it, I would very
  much like to receive a gdb (GNU Debugger) backtrace of the core
  file.  Here are the steps to generate it.

  1. Make sure you compile the PHP Apache module with debugging 
     symbols included.  ie. compile with -g and do not strip the
     final httpd binary.

  2. Make your server root directory writable to the world to allow
     the web server process to write its core file.  
     eg. chmod 777 /usr/local/etc/httpd

  3. Do whatever you need to do to cause the problem

  4. Run gdb on the core and binary files.
     eg. gdb /usr/local/etc/httpd/bin/httpd /usr/local/etc/httpd/core
     and at the gdb prompt type: bt
     Then send me the output.

  If you are unable to perform step 4 in the above but manage to get
  through step 3 and have a "core" file, then send me some email.
  I may be able to get a copy of your httpd and your core file and
  do the debugging on these files myself.

  Bug reports should be sent to rasmus@lerdorf.on.ca
  
     
Getting Updates
---------------

  Entire new distributions of the package are made available frequently
  in the file archive at http://php.iquest.net/files/

  If you don't like re-installing every time you want to update your
  package, or if you are a programmer and want to make sure you always
  have the latest bleeding-edge version of the package, get a package
  called CVS.  It is available at prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu.  Get version
  1.7 or later.  Compile and install this package.  Make sure you enable
  client support.  Check the cvs-1.7/src/options.h file and verify that
  AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT is defined.  (This probably isn't needed for
  later versions of CVS)

  Now type the following:

    cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@www.lerdorf.on.ca:/repository login

  When it asks you for a password enter: phpfi

  Then type:

    cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@www.lerdorf.on.ca:/repository checkout phpfi

  This will create a phpfi directory in your current directory.  It will
  take a bit of time, especially if your network connection is slow.  
  But once it is done, you will have an up to date copy of the master
  CVS source tree.  You can then at any time cd into this directory and
  type:
  
    cvs update

  to update your source tree to be in sync with the master tree.

  In order to compile php from this master source tree you will need the GNU
  yacc replacement called Bison.  The only difference between the CVS tree and 
  the tree you get from the file archive is that the CVS tree does not come 
  with a pre-made parser.  You will need to type: 

    make parser

  in order to create the parse.c file.

  Keep in mind that the CVS version may not always compile, or if it does
  compile, it may not be stable.  The CVS version is a development version
  and should be treated as such.
 
  If you plan on making significant contributions to the PHP/FI code, 
  CVS write access is available.  E-mail rasmus@lerdorf.on.ca for more 
  information.
