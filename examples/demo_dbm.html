These functions should look very familiar to anybody who has
worked with dbm files from C before.  For those of you that haven't,
dbm files are hashed files containing key/content pairs of data.
They allow you to quickly look up keyed data stored on disk.<p>
The unique aspect of the dbm support in PHP is that it works with
ndbm, GNU's gdbm, Berkeley's libdb or even no dbm support in which
case an internal flat ascii file format is used.  GNU's gdbm library
available from prep.ai.mit.edu is probably your best choice if you don't
have built-in ndbm support in your operating system.<p>

<b>dbmopen()</b> opens a dbm file.  The argument is the full-path filename
of the dbm file to be opened.  Note that if ndbm support is used, ndbm will
actually create <i>$filename.dir</i> and <i>$filename.pag</i> files.  gdbm
only uses one file, as does the internal flat ascii file support.  Note that
PHP does its own file locking in addition to any file locking this may be
done by the dbm library itself.<p>

<b>dbmclose()</b> simply closes the specified dbm file.  It will also
remove any lock files, so it is important to close any dbm files that
have been opened.<p>

<b>dbminsert()</b> inserts a new key/content data pair into a dbm file.  If the
key already exists, the insert will fail.<p>

<b>dbmreplace()</b> is similar to the <b>dbminsert()</b> function, the only
difference being that if the key already exists, the old content string will
be replaced with the new.<p>

<b>dbmfetch()</b> will return the content string associated with the given key.<p>

<b>dbmdelete()</b> will delete the key/content pair specified by the given key argument.<p>

<b>dbmfirstkey()</b> returns the first key in the dbm file.  Note that no particular
order is guaranteed since the order depends on hash table values calculated within the
dbm implementation.  You may use the <b>sort</b> function to sort arrays of data
from the dbm file if necessary.<p>

<b>dbmnextkey()</b> returns the next key after the specified key.  By calling <b>dbmfirstkey()</b>
followed by successive calls to <b>dbmnextkey()</b> it is possible to visit every key/content
pair in the dbm file.<p>

See the dbm man pages on your Unix system for more information on dbm files.<p>
