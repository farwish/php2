See the man pages for the srand() and rand()
C library functions for more information.  Note that these
functions are not very good random number generators, but they
should be adequate for most purposes.  <p>

The first thing to do is to seed the random number generator.
Do this with the <b>srand()</b> function.  This function takes
any integer as an argument.  One choice is to use the <b>date</b>
function to give you the current number of seconds past the minute.
ie.<br><br>
<tt>&lt;?srand(date(&quot;s&quot))&gt;</tt><br><br>
<?srand(date("s"))>
Now you can generate random numbers by simply calling the rand() function.
ie. <br><br>
<tt>&lt;?$number = rand()&gt;</tt><br><br>
You can use the getmaxrand() function to check what the maximum
possible number is on your system.  You can also adjust the  
range of possible random values by using the mod operator.  ie.<br><br>
<tt>&lt;?$number = rand() % 100&gt;</tt><br><br>
This would always produce a random number between 0 and 100.<p>

Random number between 0 and <?echo getrandmax()-1>: <?echo rand()><p>
Random number between 0 and 99: <?echo rand() % 100><p>
Random number between 50 and 59: <?echo 50 + rand()%10><p>
You may reload this page many times to verify that the generated
random numbers are within the specified ranges.  Note that the
ranges include both endpoints.<p>
