These functions allow you to manipulate strings in various ways.
They are similar in functionality to the corresponding C versions,
so you may simply read the C man pages on your system to get a better
idea of how they work.<p>

<b>strlen()</b> returns the length of the string argument.<p>
<b>strval()</b> returns the integer value of the string.  The C equivalent of this
function is the atol() function.<p>
<b>strtok()</b> is used to tokenize a string.  That is, if you have a string like
<b>&quot;This is an example string&quot;</b> you could tokenize this string into
its individual works by using the space character as the token.  You would use 
the following script code:<br><br>
<pre>&lt?
	$string = &quot;This is an example string&quot;;
	$tok = strtok($string,&quot; &quot;);
	while($tok);
		echo "Word=$tok&lt;br&gt;";
		$tok = strtok(&quot; &quot;);
	endwhile;
&gt;</pre>

The output looks like this:<br><br>
<tt><?
	$string = "This is an example string";
    $tok = strtok($string," ");
    while($tok);
        echo "Word=$tok<br>";   
        $tok = strtok(" ");
    endwhile;  
></tt><p>
Note that only the first call to <b>strtok</b> uses the string argument.  Every
subsequent call to strtok only needs the token to use as it keeps track of where
it is in the current string.  To start over, or to tokenize a new string you
simply call strtok with the string argument again to initialize it.<p>	

<b>strtoupper()</b> and <b>strtolower()</b> converts the string argument to
all upper and all lower case characters respectively.<p>

<b>strstr()</b> and <b>strchr()</b> are actually identical functions.  They
can be used interchangebly and both are included only for completeness sake.
They will return the portion of the string argument starting at the point
where the given sub-string is found.  For example, in our example string from
above, the call: <tt>&lt;echo strstr($string,&quot;an &quot;)&gt;</tt> would 
return the string: <tt>&quotan example string&quot</tt>.<p>

<b>strrchr()</b> is identical to <b>strchr</b> except for the fact that it
will start at the end of the string and search backwards for a match.<p>

Another important set of functions to know about when dealing with strings
are the regular expression functions demonstrated in the
