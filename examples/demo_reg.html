These functions allow you to perform regular expression operations
on strings.  The regular expression language used is compatible with
the extended regular expression syntax as specified in the egrep man
page on most Unix systems.<p>

<b>reg_match()</b> returns non-zero if the regular expression is matched
in the argument string.  For example, the condition, <tt>&lt?if (reg_match(&quot;^This.*&quot;,
&quot;This is an example string&quot;)&gt;</tt> would be true since the &quot;^This.*&quot;
expression says to match the word <b>This</b> at the beginning of the string and then
match any characters afterwards.<p>

<b>reg_search()</b> will scan the entire argument string for any matches to
the given regular expression.  If a match is found, it will return the portion
of the string starting at where the patch occurred.  If no match is found a
zero-length string is returned.<p>

<b>reg_replace()</b> scans the entire argument string and replaces any portions
of the string matched by the given expression with the replacement string.  For
examples, in the string, <tt>&quot;This is an example string&quot;</tt> we could 
very easily replace every space with a dash with the command: 
<b>reg_replace(" ","-","This is an example string")</b>.<p>
