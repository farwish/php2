The <b>sort()</b> function can be used to sort a PHP array.  eg. 
<pre>&lt;?
	$a[0] = 2;
	$a[1] = 1;
	$a[2] = 3;
	sort($a[0]);
	$i=0;
	while($i<3);
		echo &quot;$a[$i]&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
		$i++;
	endwhile;
&gt;</pre><p>

This results in:<br>
<?
    $a[0] = 2;
    $a[1] = 1;
    $a[2] = 3;
    sort($a[0]);
    $i=0;
    while($i<3);
        echo "$a[$i]<br>";
        $i++;
    endwhile;

The <b>include</b> command can be used to insert other files into the current
html file.  This is extremely handy for headers and footers which may need
to be included in hundreds of html files.  By using an include command you then
only need to modify the header or footer file in one place when it needs to be
changed.  Since full PHP parsing is done on the included file, you can also
use the include command to include common PHP scripts you may have written.  Sort
of like having a primitive shared library of scripts you can call from your HTML 
file.  The format of the command is: <tt><b>&lt?include "fullpath_filename"&gt;</b></tt>.<p>

The <b>crypt()</b> command will encrypt a string using the standard Unix DES
encryption method.  Arguments are a string to be encrypted and an optional
two-character salt string to base the encryption on.  See the Unix man page for
your crypt function for more information.  If you do not have a crypt function
on your Unix system, you can use Michael Glad's public domain UFC-Crypt package
which was developed in Denmark and hence not restricted by US export laws as long 
as you ftp it from an non-US site.<p>

The <b>header</b> command is used at the top of an html file to send raw HTTP
headers.  See the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/draft-ietf-http-spec.html">
http specification</a> for more information on raw http headers.<p>

The <b>exit</b> command can be used to end parsing right away at this tag.<p>

The <b>count()</b> function returns the number of items in an array variable.  If the
variable is not an array, the return value will be 1.<p>

The <b>system()</b> is just like the C system() command in that it excutes
the given unix command and output the result.<p>

The <b>exec()</b> function also executes the given unix command, however it does not
output anything.  It simply returns the last line from the result of the command.<p>
