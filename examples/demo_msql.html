mSQL is a lightweight SQL database engine for Unix systems.  It is
extremely easy to install and configure and it does a great job of
handling simple SQL queries.  It is perfect for small-scale database
needs such as those encountered by most web site designers these days.
mSQL was written in Australia by David J. Hughes and is available from
ftp.bond.edu.au.<p>

<b>msql_connect()</b> specifies the host name or IP on which the mSQL database
engine resides.  This is equivalent to the msqlConnect() function in the msql C
API.  The one difference between this function and the C API equivalent is that
if the function isn't called, a connection to the local host is made by default
on the first call to the msql() function.  And, there is no need for an msql_close
function since only one connection may be active at any one time.  If a second call
to msql_connect() is made in a file, then the connection to the first host is
automatically closed.  To explicitly connect to the msql daemon on the local host, use: 
<b><tt>&lt?msql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;)&gt</tt></b><p>

<b>msql()</b> sends an mSQL query.  Arguments are the database name and the query
string.  ie. <b><tt>&lt?msql(&quot;MyDatabase&quot;quot;select * from table&quot;)&gt</tt></b>.
The return value from this function is a result identifier to be used to access the results
from the following functions.<p>

<b>msql_result()</b> displays a field from a returned record.  Arguments are the result
identifier returned by the msql() function, an integer which is the index of the record 
to be viewed and a field name.  This is perhaps best illustrated with a complete example:<p>
<pre>
&lt;?
	msqlsethost(&quot;localhost&quot;);
	$name = &quot;bob&quot;;	
	$result = msql($database,&quot;select * from table where firstname='$name'&quot;);
	$num = msql_numrows($result);
	echo &quot;$num records found!&ltp&gt;&quot;;
	$i=0;
	while($i<$num);
		echo msql_result($result,$i,&quot;fullname&quot;);
		echo &quot;&ltbr&gt&quot;;
		echo msql_result($result,$i,&quot;address&quot;);
		echo &quot;&ltbr&gt&quot;;
		$i++;
	endwhile;
&gt;</pre>
The above script connects to the mSQL engine on the local machine, sets the <i>name</i>
variable to <i>bob</i> and sends a query which asks for all the fields from a
table where the <i>firstname</i> field is set to <i>bob</i>.  It then displays the
number of records it found after which it loops through each of the found
records and displays the <i>fullname</i> and <i>address</i> fields for each record.
As you can see, it would be trivial to add HTML markup tags around the printed
fields to format the results in a table or in whatever manner is desired.<p>

<b>msql_freeresult()</b> only needs to be called if you are worried about using
too much memory while your script is running.  All result memory will automatically
be freed when the script is finished.  But, if you are sure you are not going to
need the result data anymore in a script, you may call msql_freeresult with the
result identifier as an argument and the associated result memory will be freed.<p>

<b>msql_numrows()</b> simply returns the number of rows in a result.  The argument
is the result identifier returned by the msql() function.<p>

<b>msql_numfields()</b> returns the number of fields in a result.  The argument is
the result identifier returned by the msql() function.<p>

<b>msql_fieldname()</b> returns the name of the specified field.  Arguments to the
function is the result identifier and the field index.  ie. <tt>msql_fieldname($result,2);</tt>
will return the name of the second field in the result associated with the $result
identifier.<p>

<b>msql_fieldtype()</b> is similar to the msql_fieldname() function.  The arguments are
identical, but the field type is returned.  This will be one of "int", "char" or "real".<p>

<b>msql_fieldlen()</b> again takes the same arguments as msql_fieldname() but returns
the length of the field.<p>

<b>msql_fieldflags()</b> takes the same arguments as msql_fieldname() and returns the
field flags.  Currently this is either, "not null", "primary key", a combination
of the two or "" (an empty string).<p>
