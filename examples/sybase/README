Example of sybase support to php/fi

This is the booksmarks database example comes with w3-msql. 

* create a directory say bookmarks inside your public_html or wherever
  you keep your web pages. creating directory is not necessary but it will
  not clutter your stuff. Then copy *.html and *.gif to that directory.

* look at phpwrap.sh, define the necessary variables
  copy phpwra.sh to your cgi-bin directory. make sure php.cgi is there as 
  well.

* look at crtab.sql
    it will use the default database.
    if a table named bookmarks exists, it'll drop it first, so careful.

* isql -i crtab.sql

* load index.html in your browser.
