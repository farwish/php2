The demo_* files in this directory are a bit out of date.  They
still show interesting parts of the PHP/FI script language, but
they should not be thought of as a complete demonstration of the
software.  The doc/doc.html file should be used as the
complete reference manual for this software and in case of
any discrepancies between things in the demo_* files and
the doc.html documentation, the doc.html will have authority.
